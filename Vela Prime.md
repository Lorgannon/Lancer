Vela Prime is a Diasporan world on the far-end of the Long Rim. It was initially colonized by a generation ship launched prior to the Fall, and has enjoyed a significant degree of autonomy and isolation compared to other worlds colonized by the original ten. 

In terms of biosphere, Vela Prime is what Union Scientists would designate a 'Verdant World', mountain ranges choked with incredibly biodiverse rainforests, as well as vast flood plains swarming with a menagerie of indigenous creatures.

Politically, Vela Prime is backwards compared to the carefully curated polities enjoyed by other seed worlds, whatever generation ship landed on the planet seemed to launched with no literature beyond the primitive religious texts of Old Humanity, and as such the government of Vela is not dissimilar to that of the Holy Roman Empire, controlled in it's entirety by [[The House Of Blood]]
