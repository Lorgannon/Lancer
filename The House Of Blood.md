The House of Blood, or colloquially, The House, is the reigning government on [[Vela Prime]]. Currently ruled by [[Duke Kanik]].

- Aristocratic Regime: Rule divided up among the children of Kanik
	- [[Marquis Tsuguto]] manages defense and security forces across Vela Prime
	- [[Marchioness Lenore]] manages diplomacy and internal affairs
	- [[Viscount Obol]] manages the treasury

almost all of the high-ranking members of the house are descendants —or clones— of Kanik and his children. This is neither immediately obvious, nor an open fact.

The secret of The House, is, at least to Union, that the upper family is functionally immortal. Owing to some of the Golden-Age technology brought with their original generation ship, The House is able to essentially leech the genetic health from it's citizenry and effectively de-age its ruling class. Kanik and his children, as far as anyone can tell, were members of the original fleet that populated [[Vela Prime]]
