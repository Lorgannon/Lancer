## The Invisible Hand
We open on the [[U.C.S. Alexandria]], your squad is a team of greenhorn lancers meeting onboard as the ship waits on its turn in the blink gate. The Alexandria, as the mission brief states, is on a mission of peace. A new Diasporan world has reached out asking for resources, and to begin the process of being inducted into union space. Upon arrival, the team encounters surprising hostility high tensions. The locals are hiding something, and [[Vela Prime]] is experiencing an uprising. Eventually, as a peace conference goes sour, the team is cut off from the Alexandria, and must bargain, lie, fight, and steal their way back on.
